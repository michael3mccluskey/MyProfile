				<h2>Background information</h2>
			</header>
			<p>I was born in South Africa to British parents, I moved to Australia when I was about 10 years of age.</br>
				Being exposed to so many cultures growing up I believe I have become a person who is easy to get along with.</br>
				I completed year 12 in Australia and began studying a Bachelor of International Business at RMIT,</br>
				I have had an enjoyable time at RMIT and have completed the first 2 years of my degree. </br>
				Something you might find interesting about me is my interest in movies. </br>
				I have loved movies from a very young age, when people celebrate important moments growing up (birthdays, good grades, etc..)</br>
				they go out to eat but I’ve always wanted to watch a movie instead. I love movies so much that work at a cinema. </p>

				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
			</header>
			
				<section>
					<h3>What is your interest in IT?</h3>
					<p>My primary interest in IT is its integration with business in order to increase the customer experience.</br>
						This is seen a lot in children’s toys these days, IT elements are added to toys to increase their staying power and overall marketability.</br>
						There are countless examples, but Lego has a few products that when scanned by a smart phone display an image or play a story,</br>
						if the app keeps adding more features children can keep benefiting from the same toy much longer and companies can gain by releasing more pieces to add to the collection.</br>
						With the popularity of videogames physical toys need to evolve and become more IT heavy like Pokémon cards having the ability to become virtual cards </br>
						or Amiibo statues becoming playable characters in games.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
					<p>I’ve always had an interest in IT, when I was younger my dad would collect old PC’s and break them down using the parts to make better ones.</br>
						My interest in IT was always there but it really picked up when I took year 10 IT.</br>
						This soon became my favourite class because all the lessons were so different and interesting one day you would be disassembling and</br>
						reassembling a PC the next you would be using that PC to make a video game. I enjoyed my time in year 10 so much that I completed a certificate III in Information Technology</br>
						in years 11 and 12. Looking back my IT class has some of my fondest memories of school.</p>
	
				</section>
				
				
				<section>
					<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h3>
					<p>I came to RMIT to complete my business degree, I chose RMIT because of the flexible degree structure.</br>
						You can complete a degree by doing core subjects, but the rest of the subjects are free choice they don’t have to fit into anything.</br>
						I also like the city location of RMIT its easy to meet so many different types of people. Its city location means its difficult for me to justify driving,</br>
						so I have less of an environmental impact taking public transport to classes.  </p>
					
				</section>
<section>
					<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies? </h3>
					<p>I took this class to find a different perspective on business, completing business classes can get a bit samey and it can be hard to find inspiration.</br>
						Being exposed to a different way of thinking can inspire creativity. I would like to learn ways in which I can better utilize IT to suit my needs,</br>
						instead of tackling every problem the same way.</p>

					<h3>Online Customer Support and Training</h3>
					<p>https://www.seek.com.au/job/39611707?searchrequesttoken=574fb799-66a5-4572-8344-e6187287acd9&type=promoted</p>
					<p>It’s hard to decide on what you want your ideal job to be, I’m not really too sure in which direction I want to head when it comes to future careers.</br>
						I’m a big fan of the current gig economy where people don’t stay with the same company/position for years on end instead opting to have many different roles in their lifetime based on their relevant skills and experience.</br>
						For my ideal job I have selected the Online Customer Support and Training role offered by AroFlo. The role involves offering technical support to online clients, as well as training these clients in the proper use of products.</br>
						This role doesn’t require  any formal education, but it does require excellent communication skills, the ability to problem solve, the ability to build rapport with customers, strong multitasking and the ability to work well in a team.</br>
						The role also requires an understanding  of business management systems and web applications. I have chosen this role because I believe it will allow me to use the knowledge I have obtained from my business degree, my knowledge of IT and my experience in customer service.</br>
						Since the role doesn’t list any educational requirements there is no reason to increase my studies however I believe that it would be beneficial to undertake more classes in IT focused on web based computing and troubleshooting. I may also need to look into some</br>
						Human resources classes to increase my ability to teach others and some marketing classes to build customer relationships. I believe I should look into building relationships and making connections with staff and students at RMIT to increase my overall influence.</p>

					<h3>Tests</h3>
					<p>I have completed three online tests:</br>
Myers-Briggs test</br>
A learning style test </br>
Big five personality test</p>

					<h3>Test Results</h3>

				<section>
					<h3>Discussion</h3>
					<p>Looking at the results of the Myers-Briggs test it shows that I’m more introverted than extroverted, more observant than intuitive,</br>
						neutral when it comes to thinking vs feeling, more prospecting than judging and more turbulent than assertive. The result with</br>
						the highest leaning is tactics where I scored 85% in prospecting meaning I am generally good at improvising and spotting opportunities,</br>
						usually flexible, relaxed nonconformist with an open mind. The most middling result was nature where I scored 51% in feeling. </br>
						This result is the most surprising to me, the others I understand and could have predicted beforehand but if I had to have guessed</br>
						I would have said I would have scored much higher on feeling. The results of the learning style test revealed that I’m a primarily a visual style learner,</br>
						again this is unsurprising as this is the way most people are taught throughout their schooling.  </br>
						The big 5 personality test revealed that I have low levels of extraversion and high levels of agreeableness. These results reveal that I’ll likely be introverted when</br>
						it comes to group work which might be a bit challenging at least to begin with. My high observant score may become an asset to a group as my strong habits and focus are</br>
						likely to keep the group on track. My high prospecting score may also help as I can be flexible in a group and open to many different ideas. </br>
						Another challenge I may face is revealed by my high turbulent score showing that I can be self-conscious and sensitive to stress. When forming a team it will be important</br>
						to keep my strengths and weaknesses in mind. I believe it would be best to form a team with extroverted people, assertive people, intuitive people and people with high levels of conscientiousness.  </p>

<!-- Project Ideas Section -->
			<section id="project">
			<header class="sectionHeading">
				<h2>Project Idea</h2>
			</header>
				
				<section>
					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>My project idea is to develop an app that can be used in movie theatres by movie theatre staff that displays all relevant cinema information. The app will focus on optimising cinema cleaning time by displaying exact finish times and how long staff have to clean a particular cinema. </p>
					</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<p>I have had experience working in more than one movie theatre, these theatres have changed and evolved through the years to improve the guest experience. Many movie theatres have implemented their own apps for their customers, these apps show customers all available movies on site or all movies playing in the country.</br>
						Customers have access to candy bar items via their phone, where they can be delivered to their homes in just a few clicks. However movie theatre staff have implemented very little IT into their work, cinema cleans are deciphered from a printed grid of sessions times. This print out has very little information</br>
						which can make cleaning with as little time wasted between sessions difficult.</p>
					</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>The app would be for use by cinema staff instead of a printed copy of the day’s sessions. Needless to say the app needs to be able to complete the same job as the printout. It should be possible for the app and cinema planning software to connect in a way it is at least possible import data from cinema software onto the app</br>
						removing the need to manually enter new data everyday and the need to create a new input method. The app being the same as the printout should display all movie start times, movie end times, which cinema the movie is playing in and basic movie information (rating). This is the information the printout contains,</br>
						however the printout is static, and the information is displayed based on cinema number. The app should be able to sort the order of movies based on time for example the app should list cinema 1 which comes out at 12:00 and then show cinema 6 which come out at 12:10 instead of showing the next session for cinema 1 which is 12:30.</br>
						The app should also take the time between the next cinema clean and display it as cleaning time. Cleaning time is important because its not just the time between sessions for one cinema but the time available before another cinema is available to clean. The app should also have the ability to display the amount of tickets</br>
						purchased for a particular session. This information is important because it allows cinema staff to make more informed decisions. If a session has a small amount of people in it then less floor staff need to be allocated to clean that cinema meaning they are available to assist in candy bar or complete other duties. </br>
						The same is true if there is a full session more staff will be allocated to clean the cinema, staff will know to bring extra bins and rubbish bags which will save time walking back and forth the long cinema halls. The number of people per session will also help cinema workers to allocate certain cinemas during busy times. </br>
						When a cinema is fully booked cinema workers will physically walk in the cinema and help direct people to their seats. This process improves guest experience as everyone sits in the seat they paid for and less people have to leave the cinema searching for a staff member to resolve a dispute. </br>
						Another feature the app should have is an alert or message that pops up to remind cinema workers to check a cinema 20 minutes after the session has started. This message will prompt cinema workers to complete a cinema check, ensuring that the session is tunning smoothly and everyone is comfortable. </br>
						With the printout it is difficult to determine when to conduct a cinema check. Finally the app should have the ability to mark certain sessions, or cinemas, this is to keep track of where bins are placed, what sessions have been checked and what sessions have been cleaned and by who.</p>
					</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Tools & Technologies</h3>
					<p>Movie theatres like most modern businesses have access to tablets. I believe android is the best way to go with developing the app, it’s overall easier to set up and use while being more accessible than IOS. I believe the app can be developed using a simple machine like the ordinary laptops we use for class.</br>
						The software that could be used to develop the app would be android studio. Android studio is an extremely popular development tool used by android developers it is also free to download, comparatively simple to use and was created and currently supported by Google. It may also be appropriate to use AVD</br>
						Manager to emulate the running of android apps on a computer for easier testing.</p>
					</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Skills required</h3>
					<p>The final project when completed should be an android app that can be downloaded and installed on an android device. Most android apps are written in Java so having someone who is proficient in coding Java would be necessary. The app would take information from an existing source, so no new data base system is required.</br>
						The app does not require any specialised hardware, so its development is quite possible. Many of the listed features aren’t too complicated and should be doable by someone with the relevant coding knowledge. </p>
					</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Outcome</h3>
					<p>If the project is successful and a working app is produced I believe it will see use by cinema staff where it can be further tested and updated. If the app does in fact prove to be helpful it may see use by many different cinemas. Hopefully it will increase cinema efficiency, </br>
						make lives easier for cinema staff and create a more enjoyable experience for cinema goers. At the very least it should replace the paper printout an reduce the environmental impact cinemas make.</p>
