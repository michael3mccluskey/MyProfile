				<h2>Background information</h2>
			</header>
			<p>I was born in South Africa to British parents, I moved to Australia when I was about 10 years of age.</br>
				Being exposed to so many cultures growing up I believe I have become a person who is easy to get along with.</br>
				I completed year 12 in Australia and began studying a Bachelor of International Business at RMIT,</br>
				I have had an enjoyable time at RMIT and have completed the first 2 years of my degree. </br>
				Something you might find interesting about me is my interest in movies. </br>
				I have loved movies from a very young age, when people celebrate important moments growing up (birthdays, good grades, etc..)</br>
				they go out to eat but I’ve always wanted to watch a movie instead. I love movies so much that work at a cinema. </p>

				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
			</header>
			
				<section>
					<h3>What is your interest in IT?</h3>
					<p>My primary interest in IT is its integration with business in order to increase the customer experience.</br>
						This is seen a lot in children’s toys these days, IT elements are added to toys to increase their staying power and overall marketability.</br>
						There are countless examples, but Lego has a few products that when scanned by a smart phone display an image or play a story,</br>
						if the app keeps adding more features children can keep benefiting from the same toy much longer and companies can gain by releasing more pieces to add to the collection.</br>
						With the popularity of videogames physical toys need to evolve and become more IT heavy like Pokémon cards having the ability to become virtual cards </br>
						or Amiibo statues becoming playable characters in games.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
					<p>I’ve always had an interest in IT, when I was younger my dad would collect old PC’s and break them down using the parts to make better ones.</br>
						My interest in IT was always there but it really picked up when I took year 10 IT.</br>
						This soon became my favourite class because all the lessons were so different and interesting one day you would be disassembling and</br>
						reassembling a PC the next you would be using that PC to make a video game. I enjoyed my time in year 10 so much that I completed a certificate III in Information Technology</br>
						in years 11 and 12. Looking back my IT class has some of my fondest memories of school.</p>

					<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h3>
					<p>I came to RMIT to complete my business degree, I chose RMIT because of the flexible degree structure.</br>
						You can complete a degree by doing core subjects, but the rest of the subjects are free choice they don’t have to fit into anything.</br>
						I also like the city location of RMIT its easy to meet so many different types of people. Its city location means its difficult for me to justify driving,</br>
						so I have less of an environmental impact taking public transport to classes.  </p>
					
				</section>
<section>
					<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies? </h3>
					<p>I took this class to find a different perspective on business, completing business classes can get a bit samey and it can be hard to find inspiration.</br>
						Being exposed to a different way of thinking can inspire creativity. I would like to learn ways in which I can better utilize IT to suit my needs,</br>
						instead of tackling every problem the same way.</p>

				<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
			</header>			  
			<p>Really anything that continues to push me further...</p>
			<p>... But to answer the question I would be looking at a Business Analyst role or Security Consultant in the future.
			I'm very much interested in the security field and business management, so I'd hope to move into one of those areas and continue learning of the many different facets of IT.
			While interested in transitioning into one of those fields, I would hope to have time available to allow for me to stay within the education sector.</p>
